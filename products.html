<h1> product details </h1>
<p>
In marketing, a product is anything that can be offered to a market that might satisfy a want or need. 
In retail, products are called merchandise. In manufacturing, products are purchased as raw materials and 
sold as finished goods. Commodities are usually raw materials such as metals and agricultural products,
 but the term can also refer to anything widely available in the open market. In project management, 
 products are the formal definition of the project deliverables that form the objectives of the project.
